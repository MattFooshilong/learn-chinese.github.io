# First-Original-Project
Web app to help myself learn Chinese  </br>

You should open index.html as page 1 and then page2.html as page 2. </br>

Page 1 lets you input 5 words you want to learn for the day and page 2 store and displays them inside a table.  </br>

What is used:
- localstorage for database (because it's a small project and the data is non-sensitive so sql was not used)
- DOM
- Object literals
- Functions, loops
- Materialize (an alternative to Bootstrap)
- Flexbox in CSS
